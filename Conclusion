In this paper, we have proposed a fully automated system for COVID-
19 detection from lung HRCT scans. We also introduced a new dataset
containing 15,589 images of normal persons and 48,260 images
belonging to patients with COVID-19. At first, we proposed an image
processing algorithm to filter the proper images of the patientsâ€™ CT
scans, which show inside the lung perfectly. This algorithm helps increase
network accuracy and speed. At the next stage, we introduced a
novel deep convolutional neural network for improving classification.
This network can be used in many classification problems to improve
accuracy, especially for the images containing important objects in small
scales.
We trained three different deep convolution networks for classifying
the CT scan images into COVID-19 or normal. Our model, which utilizes
ResNet50V2, a modified feature pyramid network, and the designed
architecture, achieved the best results. After training, we used the
trained networks for running the fully automated COVID-19 identifier
system. We evaluated our system in two different ways: one on more
than 7796 images and the other one on almost 245 patients and 41,892
images with different thicknesses. For single image classification (first
evaluation way), our model showed 98.49% overall accuracy.
